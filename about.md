# About Vigilant

## Who We Are
Vigilant is a small, focused development organization driven by a simple philosophy: **learn by building**.

We believe the most effective way to grow as developers is to work on real projects, face actual challenges, and deliver usable software.

## Our Approach
1. **Start Small** - Begin with manageable scope
2. **Build Correctly** - Focus on proper architecture
3. **Iterate Often** - Continuous improvement cycles
4. **Document Everything** - Knowledge preservation

## Development Philosophy
We prioritize practical implementation over theoretical perfection. Every line of code serves a purpose, every feature solves a problem.
